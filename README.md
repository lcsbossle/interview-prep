# interview-prep

Hi!
I'm doing the [HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit/arrays/challenges), and started this repo to share my solutions to the tests.

Each folder contains the solutions to the problems of each subject, and each file contains the code in the specific format that will work on HackerRank platform if pasted directly.

I'm most familiar with Python, but I will attempt to solve some of the challenges in Elixir.

I hope you will find this useful, and I'm open to suggestions and discussions.
