# interview-prep

Hi!
I'm doing the [HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit/arrays/challenges), and started this repo to share my solutions to the tests.

Each folder contains the solutions do the problems of each subject.

I'm most familiar with Python, but I will attempt to solve some of the challenges in Elixir.

Each file contains the code in the specific format that will work on HackerRank platform if pasted directly.

I hope you will find this useful, and I'm open to suggestions and discussions.
